# Crop Prediction Model & Website

Welcome to the Crop Prediction project! This project encompasses both a crop prediction model and a website to provide users with accurate predictions for crop yields based on various factors.

## Overview

The Crop Prediction project aims to assist farmers and agricultural enthusiasts in making informed decisions about crop selection and cultivation. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we've developed a predictive model that analyzes factors such as soil quality, climate conditions, and historical data to forecast crop yields for different regions.

## Features

### Crop Prediction Model
- **Data Analysis**: Utilize historical agricultural data and machine learning algorithms to analyze factors affecting crop yields.
- **Prediction**: Generate accurate predictions for crop yields based on input parameters such as soil type, climate conditions, and crop variety.
- **Scalability**: The model is scalable and adaptable to different regions and crops, providing versatile predictions for diverse agricultural scenarios.

### Website Interface
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Navigate seamlessly through the website's intuitive interface to access crop predictions and other relevant information.
- **Input Form**: Input parameters such as soil type, climate data, and crop preferences to receive personalized crop yield predictions.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Visualize predicted crop yields and compare different scenarios using interactive charts and graphs.
- **Accessibility**: The website is accessible from any device with an internet connection, making it convenient for users to access predictions on the go.
