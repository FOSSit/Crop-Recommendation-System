# Crop Prediction Website
Welcome to the Crop Prediction Website project! This web application aims to provide users with predictions on crop yields based on various factors such as weather patterns, soil quality, historical data, and agricultural practices.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript knowledge for front-end modifications

### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:


    git clone https://github.com/your-username/crop-prediction.git


2. Install the required Python packages:


    pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Run the Flask application:


    python app.py


4. Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view the website.

## Usage

- Upon accessing the website, users will be prompted to input relevant data such as location, soil type, weather conditions, and crop type.
- The prediction model will process the input data and generate a forecast for the expected crop yield.
- Users can view the predicted yield and any additional insights provided by the system.

## Deployment

To deploy this project on a live system, you will need to:

- Obtain a domain name and hosting service.
- Configure your server environment to support Python and Flask applications.
- Set up a database system to store user inputs and prediction results (if necessary).
- Ensure proper security measures are in place to protect user data and the application itself.
