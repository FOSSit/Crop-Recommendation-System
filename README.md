Step 1: Download and Extract the Repository
Download the entire repository as a ZIP file from the repository's website (or using Git if available).
Extract the contents of the ZIP file into a folder on your Linux computer.
Step 2: Install Python3 and Virtual Environment (if not already installed)
Open a terminal window.
Check if Python 3 is installed by running python3 --version. If not installed, install Python 3 using your system's package manager (e.g., sudo apt install python3 for Debian/Ubuntu).
Install virtualenv if it's not already installed by running pip install virtualenv.
Step 3: Set up and Activate Virtual Environment
Navigate to the folder where you extracted the repository using the terminal (cd path/to/repository).
Create a virtual environment by running python3 -m venv .venv.
Activate the virtual environment:
On Linux, run source .venv/bin/activate.
Step 4: Install Required Python Libraries
While inside the virtual environment, install the required Python libraries by running:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

pip install pyqt5 pyqt5-tools mysql-connector
Make sure to include any other required libraries mentioned in your project's documentation.
Step 5: Ensure MySQL/MariaDB Server is Running
Ensure you have MySQL/MariaDB Server version 5.1 or above installed and running on your Linux system.
Step 6: Run the Application
In the terminal, navigate to the folder where you extracted the repository.
Make sure your virtual environment is activated (source .venv/bin/activate if not already activated).
Run the Python file for the MySQL Frontend GUI by executing:
Copy code
python MySQL-Frontend_v2.0XX.py
Replace MySQL-Frontend_v2.0XX.py with the actual filename if it's different.
Optional: Use Executable Shortcut
If provided, you can also use a soft link file provided in the repository to execute the MySQL Frontend GUI.
Additional Tips:
If you encounter any issues during setup or execution, refer to the troubleshooting section in your project's documentation or seek help from the project's support channels.
Make sure to deactivate the virtual environment once you're done using the application by running deactivate in the terminal.
That's it! You should now have your MySQL-Frontend-GUI up and running on your Linux system.
