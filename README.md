Crop Prediction Website<br>
Welcome to the Crop Prediction Website project! This web application aims to provide users with predictions on crop yields based on various factors such as weather patterns, soil quality, historical data, and agricultural practices.
<br><br>
Getting Started<br>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
<br><br>
Prerequisites<br>
Python 3.x<br>
Flask<br>
Pandas<br>
Scikit-learn<br>
HTML/CSS/JavaScript knowledge for front-end modifications<br>
Installing<br>
Clone the repository to your local machine:<br>
bash<br>
Copy code<br>
git clone https://github.com/your-username/crop-prediction.git<br>
Install the required Python packages:<br>
Copy code<br>
pip install -r requirements.txt<br>
Run the Flask application:<br>
Copy code<br>
python app.py<br>
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5000 to view the website.<br>
Usage<br><br>
Upon accessing the website, users will be prompted to input relevant data such as location, soil type, weather conditions, and crop type.<br>
The prediction model will process the input data and generate a forecast for the expected crop yield.<br>
Users can view the predicted yield and any additional insights provided by the system.<br>****
Deployment<br>
To deploy this project on a live system, you will need to:<br><br>
