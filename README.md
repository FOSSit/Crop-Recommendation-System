# Crop Prediction Model & Website

## Project Overview

The crop prediction model and website aim to assist farmers in making informed decisions about crop selection based on various factors such as soil type, climate, and historical data. The functionality includes:

1. **Crop Prediction Model**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data on crop yields, weather patterns, soil quality, and other relevant factors to predict the most suitable crops for a given location.
2. **Website Interface**: Provides an easy-to-use web interface where farmers can input their location and view the recommended crops based on the prediction model's analysis.
3. **Database Integration**: Stores relevant data such as crop information, historical yields, and weather data for efficient retrieval and analysis.

### Key Technologies

- **Django Framework**: Used for building the web application, handling user requests, and rendering dynamic content.
- **SQLite Database**: Lightweight database management system integrated with Django for data storage and retrieval.
- **Python**: Main programming language for both the prediction model and web application.
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Utilize libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow for building and training the crop prediction model.
