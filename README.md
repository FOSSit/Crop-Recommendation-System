# Crop Recommendation System

The Crop Recommendation System is a web application designed to assist farmers in selecting suitable crops for cultivation based on various factors such as soil type, climate, and crop characteristics. It utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze input data and provide recommendations to farmers.

## Project Overview

The Crop Recommendation System project aims to address the challenge faced by farmers in selecting the most appropriate crops for cultivation, which can significantly impact their agricultural productivity and income. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the system analyzes environmental and agronomic factors to suggest suitable crops that are likely to thrive in a given area.

Key Technologies:
- Python programming language
- Django web framework
- Machine learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn)
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript for frontend development
- SQLite database for storing crop and user data

## Installation Guide

### System Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pip package manager

### Dependency Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FOSSit/Crop-Recommendation-System.git
  ```
1. Navigate to the project directory:
     cd Crop-Recommendation-System
2.Create a virtual environment
  python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
3. Install dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
# Running the Application
1. Navigate to the project directory if not already there:
    cd Crop-Recommendation-System
2. Start the Django development server:
    python manage.py runserver
3. Access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:8000/.
# Usage Guide
Once the application is running, users can access the Crop Recommendation System through their web browser. They can input relevant information such as soil type, climate conditions, and geographical location to receive personalized crop recommendations. The system will analyze the data and provide suggestions based on machine learning models trained on historical agricultural data.
