# Crop Prediction

Crop Prediction is a web application that utilizes machine learning models to predict suitable crops based on various environmental factors and soil conditions. This project aims to assist farmers in making informed decisions about crop selection, thereby optimizing agricultural productivity.

## Project Overview

The Crop Prediction project serves the following purposes and functionalities:

- Predicts suitable crops for cultivation based on environmental factors such as temperature, rainfall, humidity, and soil conditions.
- Provides a user-friendly web interface for farmers to input relevant data and obtain crop recommendations.
- Utilizes machine learning algorithms trained on historical agricultural data to make accurate predictions.
- Offers insights into optimal crop rotation strategies to improve soil health and maximize yields.

### Key Technologies

- Django framework: Powers the backend server and handles user requests.
- SQLite database: Stores agricultural data and user information.
- Machine learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow): Implements crop prediction models.
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Develops the frontend user interface for data input and display.

## Installation Guide

### System Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package manager)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
