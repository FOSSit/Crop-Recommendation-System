## Introduction
An intuitive website involving machine learning to recommend crop variety and predict crop yield. The system aims to help farmers to cultivate proper crop for better yield production. To be precise and accurate in predicting crops, the website analyzes the nutrients present in the soil and the crop productivity based on the location. Dataset will then be trained by learning networks.
